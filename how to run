## Prerequisites
- Install dependencies for both workspaces:
	- `cd server && npm install`
	- `cd client && npm install`
- Configure `server/.env` with your Postgres connection and JWT secret (these values are baked into packaged builds).

## Local API server (development)
cd server && npm run dev

## Web (Vite) build only
cd client && npm run build

## Electron development shell
cd client && npm run electron:dev

> The dev shell expects the API server from `server/npm run dev` to already be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

## Electron production build (bundled client + server)
cd client && npm run electron:build

> This command builds the Vite bundle, compiles `server/dist`, and packages everything into `release/`. The installed desktop app automatically boots the embedded server (using the credentials from `server/.env`) and stores uploads under `%APPDATA%/Kithul Flow Ops/storage/`.
> Close any running copy of the installed desktop app before rebuilding, otherwise Windows will keep `release/win-unpacked/resources/app.asar` locked and electron-builder will fail to overwrite it.

## Seed scripts (run from server folder)
npm run seed:admin
npm run seed:centers
